This is not my first rodeo, this is the second (or third) time I set up the lovely Pi-Hole solution. Why? We want to block trackers, ads and malicious domain to protect our clients and speed up the network (since clients won't have to connect and load all content) as shown in [smarthomebeginner.com](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/pi-hole-vs-adguard-home/).

> We see **84 requests** (a reduction of **46%**), **3.19 MB transferred** (a reduction of **36%**), and took **16.37 seconds** (a reduction of **30%**).

# Installation

We will use the [GitHub doc](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole) to get some help along the way.
## Docker

We will setup the Raspberry with Docker compose. Let's copy over the default file and modify it to out wishes.

`wget https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/raw/master/examples/docker-compose.yml.example`

```sh
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:dev
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "8080:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'Europe/Oslo'
      WEBPASSWORD: ${WEBPASSWORD}
      PIHOLE_DNS_: 1.1.1.1;8.8.8.8
      WEBTHEME: default-dark
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped
```
Here we are, I did some modifications like:
- HTTP port 8080
- Using the `:dev` image due to some issues with the latest regular version.
- Changed timezone
- Set the password to an env variable
- Dark theme, you know it.
- Upstreams DNS servers, Cloudflare is fast as f so we'll go with that as primary while keeping Google there as well. Being an old Cisco admin, we might pop over to OpenDNS / Umbrella after a while.

We don't want and plain text passwords in the yml file since we might mistakenly commit it, or otherwise leak it so we will create a `.env` file

```sh
echo "WEBPASSWORD=secretpassword" > .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Start the container with `docker compose up -d` and set the service to boot on startup with `sudo systemctl enable docker`

# Access the web interface

I'll add `pi.hole` to the `/etc/hosts` file to be able to resolve it *(we probably won't need it once we start actually using the DNS server)*.

## Configure the DNS for the local network

First thing I'll do it access my routers DHCP config and point the DNS address to the Pi-Hole. It does not take many minutes until the first client start showing up to the party.

..aaaand Bob's your uncle! We really don't need to do much else unless we want some specific config. The Pi-hole is not starting to block sus domains.

## Set your own DNS records

You can create your own DNS records for local access, yay! I want to easily use SSH/HTTP etc. without statically adding rows to `/etc/hosts` for each new server.

![pihole dns](/assets/images/blogs/pihole_dns_records.png)

```sh
$ dig +short r1 @192.168.0.187
192.168.0.143
```

## Groups

Group can help us keep track of clients and policies.

## Adlists to block

There are a lot of list to start exploring on [Github](https://github.com/topics/pihole-ads-list). Here we can configure different list for different groups, like doing heavy restrction from the personal devices, while allowing Sonos unlimited access. There is also a good [article](https://avoidthehack.com/best-pihole-blocklists) looking at the "best" list.

Since the default list contains around 175 000 domains, we will leave it for now.

# Results

After only an hour, there are many request blocked, mainly an iCloud domain and some general ads. Lovely!
