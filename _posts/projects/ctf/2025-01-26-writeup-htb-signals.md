### Description

> Some amateur radio hackers captured a strange signal from space. A first analysis indicates similarities with signals transmitted by the ISS. Can you decode the signal and get the information?

#  Slow-scan television (SSTV)

The ISS (see hint) transmits [SSTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television) signals, i.e. static images. We need some kind of software to decode it.

# QSSTV

We install [QSSTV](https://github.com/ON4QZ/QSSTV) and open the file (Options -> Configurations -> Sound -> "From file", then Start the receiver) and viol√†, the flag is here!
